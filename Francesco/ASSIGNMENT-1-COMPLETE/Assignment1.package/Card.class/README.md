I represent a a single card used in a deck

I am only used inside of a Deck object. I have an index, a suit and a value.
	My index describes which card I am relative to a full 52 card deck.
		ex. index: 2 would be the 3 of clubs.
	My value is a more human friendsly description of what card I am.
		ex. value: Q would mean that I am a queen.
	
A deck object creates me, displays me and shuffles me.
